# 5.Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

##  Aim
Copy element 44 and 55 from the following tuple into a new tuple

tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)



##  Algorithm


1.Start with the given tuple:
tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

2.Identify the positions (indexes) of the required elements

3.Extract the elements from the tuple using indexing

4.Create a new tuple with these element
##  Program
```
t=()
t1=(44,55)
s=t+t1
print(s)
```
